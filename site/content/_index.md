  heading: Why Talent Factory?
  text: >-
    The Talent Factory is a place for children and adults to learn, create, and grow through arts & dance. Located in Lebanon, IN, we opened our doors in April 2015 as an Art & Dance instruction studio serving children in the Boone County community. Founders Jim & Paula Kochert believe in building a place to nurture young performers in the performing arts through creative instruction.

  heading: Our values
  text: >-
    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
